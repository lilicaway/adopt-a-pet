# Adopt a pet APP

This app is a result of taking the frondEndMasters course:

[Complete Intro to React v4! ](http://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/) by Brian Holt.

Note:
To make this app works you need to install the dependencies defined in the package.json and also get your own:

API_KEY and API_SECRET from [Petfinder API! ](http://www.petfinder.com/developers/)

Once you have your own Key and Secret, you need to add them to the .env file to make it work.

## Commands

- To install package json:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

- To run dev mode:

  ```
    npm run dev
  ```
